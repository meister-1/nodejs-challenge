# Meister1 Challenge

Preparation: We use branches to develop features. You can choose the order yourself. There is no real database implemented, we just want to see your SQL skill :-)

### Fetch products from database

Write a query to fetch data from a Postgresql. Fetch from the "products" table all "product_name"s and their accessoryIDs, if they are enabled.

Schema: https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c7e863624559cd2ff8ac682a893417bdfb8948c9/68747470733a2f2f73332e65752d63656e7472616c2d312e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f6c6c2d736f757263652d6465762f696d6167652e706e67

### Product Team wants to have a all possible product-accessory pairs

Implement a permutation algorithm in permutations.js. Result should be a type array.

### Build and run

Build and run the docker container

### Write a test for permutations.js function

To make sure that your code can be shipped, write a unit test for your permutaion code.
